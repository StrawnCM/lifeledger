# The Life Ledger 📈

> A browser-based incremental strategy game about life, finance, and the relentless march of time.

**The Life Ledger** is a minimalist, text-based simulation game inspired by *Universal Paperclips* and *Cookie Clicker*. You start at age 18 with a minimum wage job and zero assets. Your goal is to navigate the complexities of the economy, manage your health, and build a financial empire before you pass away at age 100.

## 🎮 Features

* **Financial Simulation:** Real-time compounding interest, inflation, and lifestyle creep.
* **Career Progression:** Start at a fast-food joint and work your way up to CEO through education and networking.
* **Asset Management:** Unlock the ability to trade stocks (high risk/reward) and buy real estate (passive income).
* **Peer Comparison Engine:** A dynamic "Status Meter" that compares your current net worth against the real-world average for your age group in the USA.
* **Survival Mechanics:** Balance working overtime for cash against your deteriorating health.
* **Responsive Design:** Playable on desktop or mobile browsers.

## 🚀 How to Play

### 1. The Early Grind (Age 18-25)
You start with high expenses relative to your income.
* **Work Extra Shifts** to stay out of debt.
* Spend spare cash on **Self Study** to slowly build your Skill level.

### 2. The Career Climb (Age 25-45)
* Once your Skill is high enough, **Ask for a Raise**.
* Invest in **Certifications** and **Networking** to unlock higher salary bands and better job titles.

### 3. The Wealth Phase (Age 45+)
* Once you have surplus cash, unlock the **Investment Portfolio**.
* Buy **Real Estate** for steady monthly income.
* Buy **Stocks** for long-term growth (but watch out for market volatility!).

### 4. Game Over
The game ends if:
